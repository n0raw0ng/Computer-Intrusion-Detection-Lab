# Computer-Intrusion-Detection-Lab
The "Computer Intrusion Detection" practical labs are designed to equip myself with foundational and advanced skills in network reconnaissance, system analysis, and cybersecurity threats. Through real-world simulations and tool-based exercises, I learn to identify system vulnerabilities, gather intelligence through footprinting, understand phishing strategies, and analyze network behaviors. These labs lay the groundwork for effective intrusion detection, vulnerability mitigation, and proactive cybersecurity measures in a professional environment.

` 1. Conduct Network and System Footprinting `

Ability to perform both active and passive reconnaissance, including IP discovery, OS identification, open port scanning, and domain/subdomain enumeration, which are vital for vulnerability assessments.

` 2. Analyze and Monitor Network Behavior `

Skilled in using tools like ping and Nmap to diagnose network connectivity, packet behavior, TTL responses, and detect potential security weaknesses in network configurations.

` 3. Perform Website and Social Media Reconnaissance `

Experience in mirroring websites for offline analysis and using OSINT tools like theHarvester to extract publicly available organizational information, aiding in risk assessment.

` 4. Simulate and Understand Phishing Attacks `

Hands-on knowledge in creating phishing sites, deploying social engineering attacks, and analyzing credential harvesting techniques to understand and defend against such threats.

` 5. Evaluate and Harden Web and DNS Infrastructure `

Competency in evaluating nameservers, IP delegation, and load-balancing setups such as F5 BIG-IP, which supports securing enterprise-level web services.
